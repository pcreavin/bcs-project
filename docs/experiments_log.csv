## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

By Day 10, you should have:
1. ✅ At least 3 successful deep learning experiments (4 preferred)
2. ✅ 2 baseline models for comparison (CS229 requirement)
3. ✅ Comprehensive metrics for all methods (macro-F1, underweight recall, per-class metrics)
4. ✅ Error analysis identifying key failure modes
5. ✅ Complete milestone document ready for submission
6. ✅ Reproducible codebase (anyone can run experiments)

---

## 📞 **COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL**

- Daily standup (15 min): Progress, blockers, help needed
- Shared document: Live milestone draft (Google Docs/Notion)
- Git workflow: Branch per feature, merge to main daily
- Results sharing: Use shared `outputs/` directory, tag experiments clearly

---

## ⚠️ **RISK MITIGATION**

**If experiments fail:**
- Person B: Debug immediately, try smaller batch size, fewer epochs
- Person C: Document failures in milestone (still valuable learning)

**If running out of time:**
- Prioritize: 2-3 best experiments over 4 mediocre ones
- Focus: Best method + 1 baseline minimum

**If team member falls behind:**
- Redistribute tasks immediately
- Focus on milestone document completion (most critical)

---

## 🚀 **QUICK START COMMANDS**

```bash
# Day 1: Validate setup
python test_local_setup.py  # (if you created this)

# Day 3+: Run experiments
bash scripts/run_ablation.sh

# Day 5+: Compare results
python scripts/compare_ablation.py

# Day 7+: Generate figures
python scripts/generate_figures.py  # (if created)
```

This plan should get you to a strong milestone. Adjust timelines based on your team's availability and priorities.
